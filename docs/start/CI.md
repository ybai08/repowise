# Repowise in CI

Four gates judge a pull request, each on what the change adds rather than on
the whole repository's past:

| Gate | Question | Needs | History |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `repowise coverage check` | Did the tests run the lines this change touched? | git and a coverage report | the merge-base with the target branch |
| `repowise doc-drift --check` | Does the documentation still describe files, links and commands that exist? | git | none (full history only improves rename suggestions) |
| `repowise security check` | Did this change add a secret or a risky call? | git | every commit of the change |
| `repowise risk --fail-above-percentile P` | Is this change bigger and more spread out than P% of this repository's recent commits? | git | recent commits to rank against (at least 8) |

None of them needs an index, a database, a model or an API key, and none
stores anything. They share one set of exit codes, output formats and base
resolution, described once below. Each layer's own page has the detail:
[test intelligence](../layers/TEST_INTELLIGENCE.md#patch-coverage-in-ci),
[documentation drift](../layers/DOC_DRIFT.md#in-ci),
[security](../layers/SECURITY.md#in-ci-repowise-security-check),
[change risk](../layers/CHANGE_RISK.md#in-ci).

One more command is not a gate but belongs in the same pipeline:
`repowise impacted-tests --format args` picks the tests a change needs, or
says to run them all and why. It reads an index; see
[Selecting the tests a change needs](#selecting-the-tests-a-change-needs).

## What every gate does the same way

**Exit codes.** `0` passed, or had nothing to judge. `1` the change failed the
gate. `2` the gate could not evaluate: not a git repository, an unknown
revision, no merge-base in a shallow clone, an unreadable report or baseline,
too few recent commits to rank a change against. A setup problem never reads
as a pass.

**Formats.** `--format table` (the default) for a terminal, `json` for a
script, `markdown` for a comment or a job artifact, and `github` for GitHub
Actions: up to ten annotations on the changed lines, a notice counting the
rest, and the markdown report appended to the job summary. Doc drift and
security also write `sarif` for code scanning and `gitlab`, a GitLab Code
Quality report (a JSON issue list; findings a baseline accepted are left out).
When a gate cannot evaluate, `gitlab` still prints a valid list, `[]`, and the
GitLab template writes `[]` whenever the output does not parse, so the report
artifact is never an invalid file.

**The change being judged.** Coverage, security and risk take a revision range:
`origin/main...HEAD` (three dots: what the branch did since it forked, the
pull request's view), `base..head`, or one commit. Without one they read the
target branch from the CI's own variables (`GITHUB_BASE_REF`,
`CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME`, `CHANGE_TARGET`,
`BITBUCKET_PR_DESTINATION_BRANCH`), else the remote's default branch. `risk`
does so with `--fail-above-percentile` or `--format markdown` / `github`;
otherwise an omitted range still means your uncommitted work, else `HEAD`. Doc
drift has no range: it checks the whole working tree, and a baseline limits it
to new findings.

**History.** CI checkouts are usually shallow, which leaves no merge-base.
Fetch full history (`fetch-depth: 0` on GitHub Actions, `GIT_DEPTH: 0` on
GitLab) and make sure the target branch exists as `origin/<branch>`. The
gates exit `2` rather than guess.

## Adopting the gates on an existing repository

Coverage and security judge only what a change adds, so an old untested file
or an old finding never fails a new pull request. Doc drift checks the whole
tree, so on a repository whose documentation has already drifted it fails from
the first run. Record what is there once and fail only on new drift:

```bash
repowise doc-drift --check --write-baseline .doc-drift-baseline.json
git add .doc-drift-baseline.json
```

Then pass `--baseline .doc-drift-baseline.json` (or the action's
`doc-drift-baseline` input). Entries are keyed on the document, the reference
and its target, so an edit above a finding does not turn it back into a new
one. Alternatively, `repowise doc-drift --check --since auto` judges only what
the change is answerable for (documents it edits, and documents naming files it
deletes or renames), which needs no baseline but does need `fetch-depth: 0`.

Security has a baseline too, for accepting a finding a change adds on purpose
(a documented test key, say): `repowise security check --write-baseline
.security-baseline.json` on that change records it, and `--baseline` accepts it
from then on.

## GitHub Actions

The repository is itself an action. It installs Repowise, runs the gates you
pick, keeps going when one fails so the job reports all of them, and fails the
step at the end:

```yaml
on: pull_request
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  repowise:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - run: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=lcov:coverage/lcov.info
      - uses: repowise-dev/repowise@main   # pin a release tag in production
        with:
          checks: coverage,doc-drift,security,risk
          coverage-report: coverage/lcov.info
          coverage-fail-under: 80
          risk-fail-above-percentile: 95
```

Pin a release tag rather than `main`, and set `version:` to pin the Repowise
release the action installs.

| Input | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `checks` | `doc-drift,security` | Gates to run. Coverage needs a report and risk is a policy choice, so both are opt-in. |
| `version` | latest | Repowise version to install. |
| `python-version` | `3.12` | Python to run it with (3.11 or newer). |
| `working-directory` | `.` | Where to run from. |
| `base` | from the pull request | Revision range for coverage, security and risk. |
| `coverage-report` | config, else discovery | Reports, one per line: a path or a glob (`artifacts/**/lcov.info`), optionally `path=prefix`. |
| `coverage-fail-under` | `coverage.fail_under` | Minimum patch coverage percent. |
| `coverage-min-coverable-lines` | `coverage.min_coverable_lines` | Small-change tolerance: a change with fewer changed executable lines than this never fails. |
| `coverage-fail-under-risky` | `coverage.fail_under_risky` | Minimum patch coverage percent over risky files only: hotspots or bug magnets from the index; on git alone, the top quartile of files with bug-fix history. |
| `doc-drift-baseline` | none | Committed baseline file. |
| `security-fail-on` | `high` | Lowest severity that fails: `high`, `med`, `low`. |
| `security-baseline` | none | Committed baseline file. |
| `risk-fail-above-percentile` | none | With `risk` in `checks`, fail when the change ranks above this percentile of recent commits. Empty reports the rank without gating. |
| `upload-sarif` | `false` | Upload doc drift and security findings to code scanning. |
| `impacted-tests` | `false` | Select the tests the change needs and set the `impacted-tests` and `run-all-tests` outputs. Requires a cached `.repowise` index, which the step updates; see [Selecting the tests a change needs](#selecting-the-tests-a-change-needs). |
| `impacted-tests-runner` | `auto` | Runner the `tests` output is written for: `auto`, `pytest`, `go`, `jest` or `files`. |

Outputs: `coverage`, `doc-drift`, `security` and `risk` hold each gate's exit
code (empty when not run), and `sarif-dir` the SARIF directory. With
`impacted-tests`, `impacted-tests` holds the runner arguments (or `:all`) and
`run-all-tests` is `false` only when that subset is safe to run alone.

The risk gate ranks the change against the repository's own recent commits,
so at a percentile P roughly (100 - P)% of changes fail it by construction.
A failure asks for a split or a second reviewer, not a code fix, and there is
no baseline to accept it with.

A shallow checkout still works when coverage, security or risk runs: the action
fetches the missing history and the target branch first. Checking out with
`fetch-depth: 0` skips that step.

**Code scanning.** With `upload-sarif: true` the findings appear in the
repository's Security tab and on the pull request's diff. The job then needs
`security-events: write` (and `actions: read` in a private repository). A pull
request from a fork runs with a read-only token, so the upload is skipped
there with a warning; the gates still run and still decide the check.

**Without the action,** each gate is one step:

```yaml
- run: pip install repowise
- run: repowise coverage check --report coverage/lcov.info --fail-under 80 --format github
- run: repowise doc-drift --check --format github
- run: repowise security check --format github
- run: repowise risk --fail-above-percentile 95 --format github
```

On a pull request the gates read the target branch from `GITHUB_BASE_REF`
themselves. On a `push` event there is none; pass the range explicitly, for
example `"$BEFORE..$GITHUB_SHA"` with `BEFORE: ${{ github.event.before }}` set
under `env:`.

## GitLab

Include the template and set variables for what you use:

```yaml
include:
  - remote: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/repowise-dev/repowise/main/ci/gitlab/repowise.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  REPOWISE_COVERAGE_REPORT: coverage/lcov.info
  REPOWISE_COVERAGE_FAIL_UNDER: "80"

repowise-coverage:
  needs: [test]   # the job that writes the report as an artifact
```

It adds one job per gate on merge request pipelines: `repowise-coverage` (only
when `REPOWISE_COVERAGE_REPORT` is set), `repowise-doc-drift`,
`repowise-security` and `repowise-risk` (only when
`REPOWISE_RISK_FAIL_ABOVE_PERCENTILE` is set). Each prints its markdown report
to the log and keeps it as an artifact. The doc drift and security jobs also
write a Code Quality report (`gl-code-quality-doc-drift.json`,
`gl-code-quality-security.json`), so their findings show in the merge
request's Code Quality widget, even when the gate fails the job. One more job,
`repowise-code-quality`, runs on the default branch and never fails the
pipeline: it publishes the report the widget compares a merge request against,
so only issues the merge request introduces show as new. It publishes doc
drift only: security judges only what a change adds, and the default branch
has no change to judge.
`REPOWISE_COVERAGE_REPORT` is space separated and may hold globs and
`path=prefix` entries; Repowise expands the globs, not the shell. Other
variables: `REPOWISE_VERSION`, `REPOWISE_COVERAGE_MIN_COVERABLE_LINES`,
`REPOWISE_COVERAGE_FAIL_UNDER_RISKY`, `REPOWISE_DOC_DRIFT_BASELINE`,
`REPOWISE_SECURITY_BASELINE`, `REPOWISE_SECURITY_FAIL_ON`. Override any job's
`image`, `rules` or `needs` in your own file as usual.

GitLab can also draw line coverage in the merge request diff. That comes from
your own test job, not from Repowise: have your test runner write a Cobertura
report (for example with pytest-cov) and declare it there. The same
`coverage.xml` can be your `REPOWISE_COVERAGE_REPORT`.

```yaml
test:
  script:
    - pytest --cov --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml
  artifacts:
    reports:
      coverage_report:
        coverage_format: cobertura
        path: coverage.xml
```

## Other CI systems

The gates are plain commands. Fetch the target branch, run them, and let the
exit code fail the build. Jenkins multibranch:

```bash
git fetch --no-tags origin "+refs/heads/$CHANGE_TARGET:refs/remotes/origin/$CHANGE_TARGET"
pip install repowise
repowise coverage check "origin/$CHANGE_TARGET...HEAD" --report coverage/lcov.info --fail-under 80
repowise doc-drift --check
repowise security check "origin/$CHANGE_TARGET...HEAD"
```

Bitbucket Pipelines and others work the same way with their own branch
variable; `--format markdown` or `json` gives you something to post.

## Selecting the tests a change needs

`repowise impacted-tests --format args` prints one line of arguments for a
test runner: the tests that cover or reach what the change touched. It fails
closed: whenever any part of the answer is not positively known, it prints
`:all` instead, and the reasons always go to stderr, one per line. pytest and
go reject `:all` as a path, but jest and vitest treat arguments as patterns
and would match nothing, so a pipeline must branch on the run-all flag, not on
the sentinel. Selection is not a gate: it exits `0` whether it picks a subset
or everything, and `2` only when it cannot read the change (an unknown
revision, missing history) or the config. Without a range, in CI it reads the
pull request's change the way the gates do; on a laptop it reads the staged
changes. A change that touches no file is not "no tests needed": it answers
`:all`, since there is nothing to select from.

It requires an index, because the graph is what knows which tests import or
call a file. Build one on the default branch and cache the `.repowise`
directory (the jobs below); in the pull request job, restore it and bring it up
to date with `repowise update --index-only` before selecting, which the action
and the GitLab job do for you. For the most precise answer, also ingest a
per-test coverage map with `repowise coverage add` (see
[test intelligence](../layers/TEST_INTELLIGENCE.md#impacted-tests)). Without an
index every answer is `:all`, with the reason.

**When it runs everything.** Any one of these is enough:

| Rule | Example reason |
|------|----------------|
| The change touches no file | `No change against origin/main...HEAD; nothing to select from.` |
| A changed or deleted file can change any test: a dependency lock or manifest, build or test configuration, a production package's `__init__.py`, shared test-support files (factories, fixtures directories) other than `conftest.py`, test data, CI configuration, `.repowise/config.yaml`, or a path in `tests.full_run_on` | `uv.lock changed: dependencies can change any test.` |
| A changed or deleted file sits in a test tree but is not code (data, a snapshot, a golden file) | `tests/data/users.json is in a test tree but is not code ...` |
| A changed or deleted helper module (`tests/helpers.py`) that no test imports | `tests/helpers.py is a test helper no test imports; ...` |
| A changed file the index does not know (a data file, an image or a document outside `docs/`) | `src/pkg/schema.json: no coverage, no test reaching it in the graph, no paired test.` |
| A changed code file has no known test, or only a filename guess names one | `src/new.py: only a filename guess names a test (tests/test_new.py).` |
| A route to a changed file passes through a test helper no test imports, so its users (fixtures, plugins) are unknown | `src/a.py is reached through the test helper tests/helpers.py, and no test imports that helper; ...` |
| There is no index, it was built before other files changed, its recorded commits disagree, or its graph could not be read | `The index predates 3 changed file(s) outside this change (e.g. src/b.py), ...` |
| The per-test map is at its stored row cap | `The per-test map is at its stored row cap, ...` |
| A deleted code file has no known test, or a test the index names is not in the checkout | `src/gone.py was deleted and no test is known to have used it.` |

Otherwise it selects the tests recorded coverage says run the changed lines,
together with every test the graph shows calling into or importing the changed
files, directly or through other modules and tests (coverage adds to the graph,
it never replaces it), and the changed tests themselves. A deleted test needs
no run of its own; the tests importing it do. Only documentation is skipped:
`docs/` and the root README, CHANGELOG, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING and similar
files. A document or image anywhere else may be package data a test reads, so
it runs everything; a test that reads something under `docs/` needs that path
in `tests.full_run_on`. When the per-test map was measured at neither end of
the change, covering tests are matched by file rather than by line, and the
reasons say so. A test package's `__init__.py` runs for every test under
its directory, and pytest loads a `conftest.py` for every test at or below its
directory, so a change to either, or a route through either, selects all of
those tests (basis `test-package` or `conftest`) rather than everything; a
production package's `__init__.py` still runs everything. A helper module
tests import (`tests/helpers.py`) stands for the tests that import it, directly
or through other helpers, whether it changed or sits on a route (basis
`helper-importers`); only a helper no test imports runs everything. The graph
treats only code as test material, so a JSON or golden file is never a route. `--format json` carries the
decision per file in `selected.basis`: `full-run`, `no-tests-needed`,
`test-tree`, `test-package`, `conftest`, `helper-importers`, `deleted-test`,
`coverage`, `changed-test`, `call-graph`, `import-graph`, `filename-pattern`,
`unknown`, or `none` when nothing was asked (no index), beside
`indexed_commit` and `map_current`.

**What to expect.** The subset is as small as the code is loosely coupled. On
tightly coupled code, graph-only selection picks most tests, because most tests
import something that imports the changed file; on this repository a typical
change selects over 80% of the test files. Real savings need a per-test map
(`repowise coverage add` on a report with per-test contexts) measured at the
change's base, so tests are matched by the lines they ran. Audit what drove a
selection with `--format json` and `selected.basis`.

**Runners.** `--runner pytest` gets node ids where coverage named the test
(`tests/test_api.py::test_login`) and files otherwise. `go` gets each selected
test's package directory once (`./internal/auth`), plus the package of every
changed non-test `.go` file that has tests of its own, since same-package tests
import nothing. `jest` (and vitest) and `files` get file paths; pass them with
`--runTestsByPath` so each is read as a path, not a pattern. The default,
`auto`, picks the runner every selected test belongs to, and `files` when they
are mixed. Each runner gets only the tests it can run, so one job per language
can share the selection. Paths are relative to the repository root. An empty
line means every changed file is documentation. Ceiling: on the JVM and .NET,
a test in the same package or namespace as the code needs no import either, and
only the call graph links them; when a test reaches the code only that way and
the call is not resolved, it is missed.

**Config.** Two keys in `.repowise/config.yaml` extend the defaults:

```yaml
tests:
  full_run_on: ["schema/**", "docs/api/*.md"]   # gitignore syntax; also run everything
  always_run: ["tests/test_smoke.py"]           # appended to every selection
```

`full_run_on` adds to the built-in triggers and never replaces them.
`always_run` entries are passed to the runner as written, so write them in its
terms. A key the config cannot use (not a list of non-empty strings, or a
misspelt key under `tests:`) exits `2`.

On GitHub Actions, a workflow on the default branch keeps the index cached,
and the pull request job turns on `impacted-tests` and branches on the outputs:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/repowise-index.yml: keep the cached index current
on: {push: {branches: [main]}}
jobs:
  index:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: {fetch-depth: 0}
      - uses: actions/cache/restore@v4
        with: {path: .repowise, key: "repowise-${{ github.sha }}", restore-keys: "repowise-"}
      - run: pip install repowise
      - run: if [ -f .repowise/state.json ]; then repowise update --index-only; else repowise init --yes --index-only; fi
      - uses: actions/cache/save@v4
        with: {path: .repowise, key: "repowise-${{ github.sha }}"}
```

```yaml
# in the pull request workflow
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with: {fetch-depth: 0}
- uses: actions/cache/restore@v4
  with: {path: .repowise, key: "repowise-${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}", restore-keys: "repowise-"}
- id: select
  uses: repowise-dev/repowise@main
  with:
    checks: ""
    impacted-tests: true
    impacted-tests-runner: pytest
- if: steps.select.outputs.run-all-tests != 'false'
  run: pytest
- if: steps.select.outputs.run-all-tests == 'false' && steps.select.outputs.impacted-tests != ''
  env: {TESTS: "${{ steps.select.outputs.impacted-tests }}"}
  run: eval "pytest $TESTS"
```

With `checks: ""` the action only selects. Branch on `!= 'false'`: a step that
was skipped or failed leaves the output empty, which then runs everything.
When the index cannot be updated or selection cannot run, `run-all-tests` is
`true` and a warning names why, so a broken setup costs a full run, never a
skipped test.

On GitLab, set `REPOWISE_IMPACTED_TESTS: "true"` (and optionally
`REPOWISE_IMPACTED_TESTS_RUNNER`). The `repowise-impacted-tests` job writes
the arguments to the `impacted-tests.txt` artifact and only `RUN_ALL_TESTS` to
a dotenv report; it is `false` only when the subset is safe to run alone:

```yaml
repowise-index:   # keeps the cached index current on the default branch
  image: python:3.12
  variables: {GIT_DEPTH: "0"}
  script:
    - pip install repowise
    - if [ -f .repowise/state.json ]; then repowise update --index-only; else repowise init --yes --index-only; fi
  cache: {key: repowise-index, paths: [.repowise/], policy: pull-push}
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

repowise-impacted-tests:
  cache: {key: repowise-index, paths: [.repowise/], policy: pull}

test:
  needs: [{job: repowise-impacted-tests, optional: true}]
  script:
    - |
      if [ "${RUN_ALL_TESTS:-}" != "false" ]; then pytest
      elif [ -s impacted-tests.txt ] && [ -n "$(cat impacted-tests.txt)" ]; then eval "pytest $(cat impacted-tests.txt)"
      fi
```

When the cached index cannot be updated or selection cannot run, the job still
passes and reports `RUN_ALL_TESTS=true`. When it did not run at all,
`RUN_ALL_TESTS` is unset and the test job runs everything. The arguments are shell-quoted, so `eval` keeps a node id with
a space in its parameters as one argument.

## Coverage reports per language

The coverage gate needs the lines each file could have run, not only the lines
it did, and a new file no test loads must still appear in the report or it is
listed as "not in report" and left out of the figure. These commands do both:

| Stack | Produce the report | Pass |
|-------|--------------------|------|
| Python (pytest) | `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=lcov:coverage/lcov.info` (lcov paths are relative to the working directory) | `coverage/lcov.info` |
| Python (coverage.py) | `coverage lcov` or `coverage xml` after the run | `coverage.lcov`, `coverage.xml` |
| Go | `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./... ./...` (`-coverpkg` includes packages with no tests) | `coverage.out` |
| Java or Kotlin (Gradle) | `gradle test jacocoTestReport` with the XML report on | `build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml` |
| Java (Maven) | `mvn test jacoco:report` (`report-aggregate` for a multi-module build) | `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml` |
| JavaScript or TypeScript | `c8 --all --reporter=lcov`, or a test runner's `lcov` reporter with every source file included | `coverage/lcov.info` |
| Rust | `cargo llvm-cov --lcov --output-path coverage/lcov.info` | `coverage/lcov.info` |

Several reports merge: a line any of them ran counts as run. A coverage.py
`.coverage` database is not a text report; export it first. When report paths
do not line up with the repository (a build directory, a container path), set
`coverage.strip_prefix` or `coverage.path_prefix` in `.repowise/config.yaml`.
The gate reports how many report paths matched the repository, and exits `2`
when none did, so a wrong prefix never passes as zero.

The threshold can live in config instead of the workflow:

```yaml
# .repowise/config.yaml
coverage:
  paths: [coverage/lcov.info]
  fail_under: 80
  min_coverable_lines: 5   # small-change tolerance
  fail_under_risky: 90     # optional, see Risk-weighted patch coverage
```

With `min_coverable_lines` set, a change touching fewer changed executable
lines than that is still reported against the threshold, but a miss reads
"not applied" (a notice on GitHub) and exits `0`: one uncovered line in a
two-line fix should not block a merge. Like the percentage, the count is of
lines the report measures; a file the report does not name adds nothing to it.

### Monorepos and matrix jobs

A matrix of test jobs leaves one report per shard. `--report` (and each line
of `coverage-report`) takes a glob, relative to the working directory, so
`artifacts/**/lcov.info` reads them all; they merge hit-wins. `**` walks the
tree the way discovery does, skipping dependency, cache and build directories
(`node_modules`, `.venv`, `dist`, ...) and nested repositories. A job whose
reports never arrived exits `2`: a literal path that does not exist, or a
glob that matches nothing, cannot be evaluated. A glob still matches when one
shard of several is missing, so to catch that, list each shard's report on
its own line. `coverage.paths` entries that match nothing are skipped.

On GitHub Actions, each shard uploads its report and the gate job downloads
them all:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix: {shard: [1, 2, 3]}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: pytest tests/shard${{ matrix.shard }} --cov=src --cov-report=lcov:coverage/lcov.info
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with: {name: "coverage-${{ matrix.shard }}", path: coverage/lcov.info}
  coverage:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: {fetch-depth: 0}
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with: {pattern: "coverage-*", path: artifacts}
      - uses: repowise-dev/repowise@main
        with:
          checks: coverage
          coverage-report: artifacts/**/lcov.info
```

On GitLab, give each parallel shard its own path and let the gate job need
them:

```yaml
test:
  parallel: 3
  script: pytest tests/shard$CI_NODE_INDEX --cov=src --cov-report=lcov:coverage/$CI_NODE_INDEX/lcov.info
  artifacts:
    paths: [coverage/]

variables:
  REPOWISE_COVERAGE_REPORT: "coverage/**/lcov.info"

repowise-coverage:
  needs: [test]
```

When one package's report names paths relative to that package, give it a
per-report prefix: `--report web/coverage/lcov.info=web`. The whole argument
is tried as a path or glob first, so `artifacts/shard=1/*.info` stays one;
only when it matches nothing is it split on the last `=`. In config the same
is a mapping entry, and `paths` entries may be globs, relative to the
repository root:

```yaml
coverage:
  paths:
    - {path: "web/coverage/lcov.info", path_prefix: web}
    - "services/*/coverage.xml"
  ignore: ["**/*_pb2.py", "gen/"]   # gitignore syntax
```

`coverage.ignore` leaves generated or vendored files out on both sides:
changed files it matches are dropped before measuring (the summary counts them
as ignored, here and in the editor and agent views), and report entries it
matches are not stored by `repowise coverage add` or indexing. When it leaves
out every entry of the reports, the gate exits `2` and says so.

Go coverprofiles name files by import path. When a module lives in a
subdirectory (`backend/go.mod` declaring `module example.com/m`), paths under
`example.com/m/` are mapped to `backend/` using the `go.mod` files in the
checkout, so files in the module's top-level package match with no prefix.
A per-report prefix or `coverage.path_prefix` turns the mapping off.

### Path-scoped gates

One threshold over the whole change lets a well-tested package carry an
untested one. `coverage.gates` adds a gate per part of the repository: each is
judged on the changed files its globs match, with the same rules as the
whole-change gate. Globs use gitignore syntax, like `coverage.ignore`, and are
relative to the repository root; a leading `/` anchors one there (`/api/` is
the top-level `api` directory, `api/` any directory of that name).

```yaml
# .repowise/config.yaml
coverage:
  fail_under: 70                # the whole change, as before
  gates:
    - name: api
      paths: ["/services/api/"]
      fail_under: 85
    - name: web
      paths: ["/apps/web/", "!/apps/web/generated/"]
      fail_under: 60
    - name: scripts
      paths: ["/scripts/"]
      fail_under: 50
      informational: true       # reported, never fails
```

A gate without `fail_under` is reported but judges nothing. A file can match
several gates; each counts it. The change fails when the whole-change gate
fails or when any gate that is not `informational` fails. The headline then
leads with the failing gate and its counts (`Fails: path-scoped gate api 60.0%
(6 of 10 changed executable lines), below its 85.0% gate.`) before the
whole-change verdict, the summary adds a table of gates (failing ones first),
and on GitHub each failing gate is its own `::error::`; an informational gate
below its threshold is a `::notice::`. The small-change tolerance is the whole
change's: when the change has fewer changed executable lines than
`min_coverable_lines`, every gate reads `too_small`, but a small slice of a
big change is judged. An entry the config cannot use (no name, a repeated
name, no paths or only `!` exclusions, a `fail_under` outside 0-100, an
unknown key) makes the check exit `2` naming it.

Like the whole-change figure, a gate counts only changed lines the report
measures. A changed file it matches that the report does not measure (a new
file no test loads, a report without line data) is counted apart, as
`unmeasured_file_count`, and left out of the percentage: a gate over only such
files reads "no measured changed lines (2 changed files not measured)" and
fails nothing.

With one report per job, each job would judge the gates on a fragment of the
change: run `coverage check` once over the combined reports instead, as in
[Monorepos and matrix jobs](#monorepos-and-matrix-jobs).

The gates live in the committed config, so the Action and the GitLab template
take no input for them: every job reads the same gates. The editor, REST and
agent views report the same verdicts when the stored coverage was measured at
the change's head and the config is valid; on stale coverage, or beside an
invalid entry (which they list in `scope.config_errors`), their gates read
`no_data`. To start, let Repowise propose some:

```bash
repowise coverage suggest-gates                # YAML to paste below coverage:
repowise coverage suggest-gates --format json
```

It reads CODEOWNERS (one gate per owner), the top-level packages git tracks,
and, when the repository is indexed, the graph's communities, labelling each
source in a comment. The block is indented to paste directly below your
`coverage:` line. It writes nothing and sets no `fail_under`: keep the gates
you want and choose their thresholds.

### Risk-weighted patch coverage

An uncovered line in a file that keeps breaking matters more than one in a
file nothing depends on. Every changed file in the coverage report carries its
risk, and the table, the annotations and the summary list the riskiest files
first, with a "Risk" column in plain words ("hotspot, bug-fix weight 3.2, 14
dependents", "none known", or "unknown" when it could not be read). A file is
risky when the index flags it a hotspot or a bug magnet; without an index, or
for a file the change adds, when its recency-weighted bug-fix weight from git
is in the top quartile of the files with bug-fix history. The report says
which basis each row used when not every file had index data. When an index is
present, each annotation also names the test file to extend when one is found
("Extend tests/test_auth.py (inferred: calls reach `login`)").

`--fail-under-risky` (the action's `coverage-fail-under-risky`) adds one more
gate, stricter, over the risky files' changed lines alone, and the check fails
when any gate fails. It follows the same rules as the others, the whole
change's small-change tolerance included. A change that touches no risky file
leaves it not applied (`no_data`, exit `0`). With the gate set, a shallow
clone, or a measured file whose risk could not be read (no git history and no
index row), exits `2`, unless the whole-change or a path-scoped gate already
failed: that failure is reported.
