# Test Intelligence

Ingest a coverage report and repowise can answer two questions your CI cannot:
which files are risky *and* untested, and which tests a given diff actually
exercises. That second one turns a 4,000-test suite into the 40 tests that guard
the change you just made. The same report also gates a pull request on its
patch coverage, with no index at all (see
[Patch coverage in CI](#patch-coverage-in-ci)).

Without a coverage report there is still an answer, a weaker one. The dependency
graph records which test files import which source files, so repowise can say
*something reaches this* even where nothing measured it. That inferred tier needs
no setup and is always labelled as inferred. See
[The inferred tier](#the-inferred-tier-no-coverage-report-needed).

Everything here is an index lookup: no LLM, no network.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Produce a report. Any of these work.
pytest --cov --cov-report=lcov:coverage.lcov
coverage run --contexts=test -m pytest      # also builds the per-test map

# 2. Ingest it.
repowise coverage add coverage.lcov
repowise coverage add .coverage             # per-file coverage + per-test map
repowise coverage status

# 3. Use it.
repowise health                             # untested hotspots now light up
repowise impacted-tests main..HEAD          # the tests guarding this branch
repowise impacted-tests main..HEAD --format list | xargs pytest
```

## Two dimensions, one command

`repowise coverage add` stores two different things, and the difference matters
for everything below.

| Dimension | What a row says | Powers |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Per-file aggregate** | This file is 71% covered, merged across every test. | `untested_hotspot`, `coverage_gap`, `coverage_gradient` in [code health](CODE_HEALTH.md), the coverage dashboard |
| **Per-test map** | Test `tests/test_auth.py::test_login` covered lines 40-58 of `src/auth/service.py`. | `repowise impacted-tests`, `get_change_risk`'s `impacted_tests`, `get_risk`'s `tests_to_run` |
| **Inferred map** (no ingest) | `tests/test_round_trips.py` imports `src/auth/service.py`, so it reaches it. | The fallback under every row above, always labelled `inferred` <!-- repowise-drift-ignore --> |

The aggregate always gets stored. The map is only built when the report carries
per-test contexts. A report without contexts still ingests fine, it just skips
the map. The inferred map is not stored at all: it is read off the graph when
asked.

Both are point-in-time: each ingest replaces the previous rows rather than
appending history. Ingest at the same commit you intend to query, so line numbers
line up.

## Supported formats

| Format | Detected by | Per-test map |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **LCOV** | Leading `TN:` / `SF:`, or any `TN\|SF\|DA\|BRDA\|LF\|LH\|BRF\|BRH:` line | Yes, when each record carries a non-blank `TN:` test name |
| **Cobertura** XML | `<coverage` plus `<packages` or `line-rate` | No |
| **Clover** XML | `<coverage` plus `<project` | No |
| **JaCoCo** XML | The JaCoCo doctype, or a `<report` root | No |
| **Go coverprofile** (`go test -coverprofile`) | Leading `mode:` line | No |
| **coverage.py `.coverage`** | SQLite magic bytes | Yes, when written with `--contexts` |
| **Normalized JSON** (`repowise-coverage-v1`) | Leading `{` plus `repowise-coverage` or `line_coverage_pct` | No |

A UTF-8 byte-order mark at the start of a report is ignored. Go percentages are
line-based, not the statement percentage `go tool cover -func` prints. A Go
profile records blocks rather than lines, so every line a block spans counts as
executable, and a comment inside an unexecuted block reads as uncovered.

Force a parser with
`--format lcov|cobertura|clover|repowise-json|go-coverprofile|jacoco`. The
normalized JSON shape lets you feed any runner once you map it:

```json
{ "format": "repowise-coverage-v1",
  "files": { "src/foo.py": { "line_coverage_pct": 87.5,
                             "total_coverable_lines": 40,
                             "covered_lines": [1, 2, 5],
                             "coverable_lines": [1, 2, 3, 5] } } }
```

`covered_lines` and `coverable_lines` are optional. Patch coverage needs
`coverable_lines` (the executable-line set); without it a file reads as having
no line data, never as 0%.

With no path argument, `add` auto-discovers `coverage/lcov.info`, `lcov.info`,
`coverage.lcov`, `coverage.xml`, `**/cobertura.xml`, `**/clover.xml`,
`target/llvm-cov/**/*.lcov`, `coverage.out`, `cover.out`,
`**/target/site/jacoco*/jacoco.xml`, a root-module
`build/reports/jacoco/**/*.xml` (pass a nested Gradle module's report
explicitly), and a repo-root `.coverage`. Multiple reports merge with hit-wins:
covered lines and coverable lines are each unioned.

Report paths are matched to indexed files by exact key first, then basename, then
the longest trailing-path overlap. A tie refuses to guess and is reported as
ambiguous rather than mapped to the wrong file. If a whole report comes back
unmatched, set `coverage.strip_prefix` in `.repowise/config.yaml`.

Each ingest records how the report mapped: every format merged, how many of
its paths matched, did not match or tied, a short sample of the misses, and
the commit it was measured at. The coverage summary (REST `/health/coverage`,
MCP `get_health`) reports it as `report_paths`, and its `freshness` says
whether the measurement matches the indexed commit. Stored patch coverage
reads the same record, so its report path counts are real numbers rather than
null.

Ingest records are kept as history, not replaced: each one also stores the
repo-wide line and branch coverage it measured, and the newest 50 are
retained. REST `/health/coverage` returns them oldest first as `history`, and
the Coverage tab draws a trend under the headline figure once there are three
reports. Partial ingests are left out of the trend, since their figure covers
a fragment of the repository. A local index created before this change keeps
a single record per repository (its table still carries the old uniqueness
rule) until it is rebuilt.

A few rules keep that matching honest in monorepos and mixed layouts:

- A match needs more than the basename when the report names a directory:
  `other/pkg/utils.py` never maps to `src/utils.py`. A root-level file still
  matches under an absolute path, because the whole key is the path's tail.
- A relative path is first tried under the report's own directory and its
  parents, nearest first, so `packages/web/coverage/lcov.info` naming
  `src/index.ts` maps to `packages/web/src/index.ts`. A remaining tie prefers
  the file nearest the report.
- Cobertura paths are joined to each `<source>` root before matching, which
  separates files that share a name under different packages.

## Building a per-test map

The map needs a report that records *which test* covered each line. Two paths
exist today.

**coverage.py dynamic contexts** (the main one):

```bash
coverage run --contexts=test -m pytest
repowise coverage add .coverage
```

The `.coverage` file is read directly as read-only SQLite. Repowise decodes the
`numbits` line bitmaps itself, so it has no runtime dependency on coverage.py,
and falls back to the `arc` table when line bits are absent. Contexts look like
`tests/test_auth.py::TestLogin::test_ok|run`; the leading path becomes the test's
own file when it is resolvable.

**Per-test LCOV:** a report where each `end_of_record` block carries a distinct
`TN:` name. Blocks with a blank `TN:` are skipped. A bare suite label with no
path resolves to a test id with no test file, which is still usable for "run
these" but not for staleness reasoning.

If you ran without contexts, `coverage add` says so explicitly rather than
silently producing an empty map.

Rows land in a `test_coverage` table indexed both ways (repo plus source file for
the reverse lookup, repo plus test id for the forward one), capped at 250,000
rows. The CLI reports how many were dropped if you hit the cap.

## Impacted tests

`repowise impacted-tests` diffs a change, looks up the changed *lines* in the
map, and returns the tests whose recorded coverage intersects them.

```bash
repowise impacted-tests                        # staged changes (the default)
repowise impacted-tests main...HEAD            # a branch or PR, from the merge-base
repowise impacted-tests main..HEAD             # a plain range
repowise impacted-tests abc123                 # a single commit
repowise impacted-tests main..HEAD --format list | xargs pytest
repowise impacted-tests main...HEAD --format args --runner pytest   # for CI
```

| Flag | Values |
|------|--------|
| `--path` | Repo path (defaults to cwd, or the workspace primary) |
| `--staged` | Diff `git diff --cached`. Implied with no range outside CI; in CI the default is the pull request's change |
| `--format` | `table` (default), `json` (full report), `list` (test ids, one per line), `args` (runner arguments, or `:all`) |
| `--runner` | For `--format args`: `auto` (default), `pytest`, `go`, `jest`, `files` |

It always says which path fired, and it never lets a guess pass for evidence:

| Situation | Reported as |
|-----------|-------------|
| Changed file has per-test coverage on the changed lines | The exact covering tests, `via: coverage` |
| The changed file is itself a test | Itself, `via: changed-test` |
| Changed file has no coverage rows, but a test reaches it in the graph | Those test files, `via: call-graph` or `via: import-graph` (direct or transitive), in the "NOT coverage-backed" table |
| No coverage and no graph edge, but a name-shaped match | That file, `via: filename-pattern`, in the same table |
| None of the above | "unknown, run the full suite to be safe" |
| No map ingested at all | A prompt to run `coverage add` on a report with contexts |

Changed lines are matched at the commit the map was measured at (the change's
base or head); otherwise, and for deleted or removal-only files, matching is by
file and the graph is asked too. With `--format list` the caveats go to stderr
so the pipe into `pytest` stays clean. The command exits `0` in every one of
these cases, including "no tests found": it is a reporting tool, not a gate.

For CI, `--format args` prints the runner arguments, or `:all` whenever any part
of the answer is not known, with the reasons on stderr. The rules, the
`tests.*` config keys and the CI recipes are in
[CI](../start/CI.md#selecting-the-tests-a-change-needs).

A `base...head` range diffs from the merge-base of the two, so it is what a pull
request changed: commits that landed on `base` after the branch forked stay out.
`base..head` is the plain range. Every command that reads a range follows the
same rule, change risk (`repowise risk`, `get_change_risk`) included.

## Patch coverage in CI

`repowise coverage check [REVSPEC]` is the gate: of the lines a change touched
that the report calls executable, what share did the tests run?

```bash
repowise coverage check origin/main...HEAD --report coverage/lcov.info --fail-under 80
```

It needs git and a report, nothing else: no index, no ingest, no LLM key.
Report paths are resolved against `git ls-files` rather than an index, so a file
the change adds resolves too. Without `REVSPEC` the base comes from the CI's
pull-request variables, else the default branch; pass it explicitly in CI so the
job says what it measures. Reports come from `--report`, else `coverage.paths`,
else discovery, else (locally) the coverage an index already stores from
`coverage add`.

The same figure is on every surface, from the same computation over stored
coverage: `get_change_risk`'s `patch_coverage` block, and
`GET /api/repos/{id}/health/coverage/patch?base=&head=` (diffs `base...head`; `null`
when nothing is ingested), which the editor's branch-risk view reads. Stored
coverage measured at another commit than the change's head is marked `stale`.

The denominator is changed lines the report marks executable, so a changed
comment or blank line is neither covered nor uncovered. What counts is decided by
the report:

| Status | Meaning | In the % |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `measured` | The report names the file and some changed lines are executable | Yes |
| `no_coverable_changes` | The report names the file, but no changed line is executable | No |
| `not_in_report` | The report does not name the file, but it has an extension the report measures, e.g. a new source file no test loaded | No. Listed as "not in report", never 0% |
| `no_line_data` | The report names the file but gives no executable-line set for it | No |

Changed test files, and file types the report never measures (docs, config), are
out of scope and only counted. A change with no measured lines has nothing to
judge and passes.

The threshold comes from `--fail-under`, else `coverage.fail_under` in
`.repowise/config.yaml` (read at the repository root, even with `--path`); with
neither, the check reports without gating. `--min-coverable-lines` (else
`coverage.min_coverable_lines`) is the small-change tolerance: a change with
fewer changed executable lines than that, counting only lines the report
measures as the percentage does, is reported against the threshold, but a miss
reads `too_small` and does not fail. `--report` takes globs and `PATH=PREFIX`,
`coverage.ignore` leaves generated files out, and Go module paths map to their
`go.mod` directory; see
[Monorepos and matrix jobs](../start/CI.md#monorepos-and-matrix-jobs).
`coverage.gates` adds path-scoped gates: each judges the changed files its
globs match with the same rule (the small-change tolerance stays the whole
change's), a file can count in several, and a path-scoped gate that is not
informational fails the change when it fails, whatever the whole-change
figure (`path_gates` in the JSON, REST and agent output; the read-only
surfaces judge them only on coverage measured at the change's head and valid
config, see [Path-scoped gates](../start/CI.md#path-scoped-gates)).
`repowise coverage suggest-gates` proposes gates from CODEOWNERS, the
top-level packages and, when indexed, the graph's communities. The
gate compares the unrounded figure; the displayed one is floored to one
decimal, so 79.99% reads 79.9% and fails an 80% gate. Exit `0` passes (or had
nothing to judge), `1` is below the gate or a path-scoped gate fails, `2`
means the check could not run:
no report found, readable or matching a repository file, an unknown revision,
no merge-base (a shallow clone), a single commit at a shallow clone's
boundary, bad config, or not a git repository.

`--format github` writes up to 10 `::warning` annotations (riskiest file first,
then largest uncovered range), a notice counting the rest, an `::error::` for
each gate that fails and a notice when the small-change tolerance exempts one,
then appends the markdown summary to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. `markdown` and
`json` suit other CI systems.

### Risk of each changed file

Every row carries the risk of its file (`risk` on each file in `json`, the REST
response and `get_change_risk`'s `patch_coverage` block): `fix_pressure` (the
recency-weighted bug-fix count from git, read at the change's merge-base),
`dependents` (import fan-in from the index graph), the index's `hotspot` and
`bug_magnet` flags, `risky`, `reasons`, and `basis`. Risky reuses existing
rules: with index data for the file, a hotspot or a bug magnet; on git alone
(no index, or a file the change adds, which the index cannot know), the top
quartile of files with bug-fix history, by fix pressure. Ranking only among
files that have been fixed keeps "fixed once" from qualifying in a repository
where most files never were. `basis` is `git_and_index`, `git`, `index` (the
git walk failed) or `unavailable`. `coverage check` always reads git and adds
the index when one opens; a missing or unreadable index never fails it.

Rows, annotations and the markdown table list risky files first, then by fix
pressure, dependents and uncovered lines. The table gains a "Risk" column in
words ("hotspot, bug-fix weight 3.2, 14 dependents", "none known", "unknown"),
and a line states the basis when not every row had index data.

`--fail-under-risky PCT` (or `coverage.fail_under_risky`, validated like
`fail_under`) adds a stricter gate over the risky files' changed executable
lines. `risky` in `json` carries its covered and coverable counts, percentage,
file count and `gate`. It uses the same rule as the other gates, including the
whole change's small-change tolerance: a small change is exempt (`too_small`),
a small risky slice of a big one is not. The overall `gate` fails when the flat
gate, a path-scoped gate that is not informational, or the risky gate fails;
the flat gate's own rule is unchanged. No risky file with a changed executable
line leaves the risky gate not applied (`no_data`, exit `0`). With the flag
set, a shallow clone or a measured row whose risk could not be read exits `2`,
unless the flat or a path-scoped gate already failed, which is then reported
as the failure.

### Where to add the test

With an index, each uncovered range also says where its test belongs, naming
the test file to extend when one is found (`hints` on each measured row in
`json`, the REST response and `get_change_risk`). `hints` is `null` without an
index or when it could not be read; a measured row with no uncovered range has
an empty list; every uncovered range the index was asked about has a hint, with
basis `none` when nothing names a test. A hint names the innermost indexed
symbol containing the range (`null` outside any), up to three test files (best
first), the `basis` that found them and `total`, how many qualified before the
cap. Evidence is tried strongest first:

| `basis` | The test files are | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `per_test` | tests the per-test map says ran other lines of that symbol, or lines within 5 of a range outside any symbol; only when the coverage is `current` for the change | measured |
| `call_graph` | tests whose calls reach that symbol | inferred, symbol-precise |
| `import_graph` | tests that import the file | inferred, file-level |
| `none` | nothing names a test | the range needs a new one |

The index stores symbol lines at the commit it was built from. When the change
ends somewhere else (always, for uncommitted work), each file's symbols are
moved through the diff from that commit, so a range in a function added since
the index has no symbol and falls to file-level evidence.

Hints cover the first 8 ranges of each file, the ones every rendering lists.
The markdown table gains an "Extend" column ("extend tests/test_auth.py
(inferred: calls reach `login`)", "(measured: runs other lines of `login`)",
"(inferred: imports this file)", or "no test reaches this; add one"), the
terminal table the same, and each GitHub annotation ends with the same phrase.
Hints are advice: a missing or unreadable index leaves them `null` and never
changes the verdict.

A coverage.py `.coverage` database is not a text report: export it with
`coverage lcov` or `coverage xml` first.

CI checkouts are often shallow, which leaves no merge-base to diff from. Fetch
full history (`fetch-depth: 0` on GitHub Actions, `GIT_DEPTH: 0` on GitLab).
The GitHub Action, the GitLab template and the report command for each language
are in [Repowise in CI](../start/CI.md). A new file no test loads must still
appear in the report, or it reads "not in report" and is not counted; the
per-language commands there make sure it does.

## Untested hotspots

Coverage feeds the [code health](CODE_HEALTH.md) layer's test-coverage markers.
The sharpest of them is `untested_hotspot`, the textbook "write tests before you
refactor" case. It fires only when a file is all three of:

1. **A hotspot.** Flagged as one by the git layer, or 8+ commits in 90 days, or a
   temporal hotspot score at or above 0.8.
2. **Centrally depended on.** At least 4 dependents. Below that, a churning file
   is usually a leaf one author is iterating on, and flagging it is noise.
3. **Under-tested.** Line coverage below 40%. When no coverage has been ingested
   at all, it falls back to firing only when *nothing* says a test touches the
   file: no paired test file by name, and no test reaching it in the import
   graph. Either signal suppresses the finding, because this is the one place
   the layer asserts a negative and the bar for asserting it is no evidence at
   all. The graph half is what fixed the long-standing false positive on suites
   that name their tests for behaviour rather than for the file under test.

Severity is `CRITICAL` at 15% coverage or less with 10+ dependents, `HIGH` at one
of those two, `MEDIUM` otherwise. Its sibling `coverage_gap` handles the
has-coverage-but-thin case, and `coverage_gradient` applies a continuous
deduction proportional to the uncovered fraction, so a file is penalised in
proportion to how much of it is untested rather than only at a cliff.

## From an agent

Two MCP tools carry test information, at two different granularities.

**`get_risk(changed_files=[...])`** leads with a `directive` block whose
`test_recommendations` names tests for the changed *files*. It is file-level,
scoped to the diff, and capped at ten. Each row keeps its machine-readable
`basis`, repository identity, source files, and evidence:

| Row `basis` | Recommendation holds | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `measured` | test node id | the available per-test map found the test covering a changed file |
| `inferred` | test file path | the graph shows the test reaching the change; a candidate, not coverage proof |

`tests_to_run` is the compatibility id projection. It preserves the historical
measured-first fallback and its `measured` / `inferred` / `none` scalar domain;
new consumers use the adjacent typed rows for the additive evidence union.
Total/emitted/truncated/omitted fields cover each exact population before its
cap. `coverage_analysis` separately reports
available, unavailable, partial, degraded, and stale states; an empty list under
unavailable analysis is unknown and never means "no tests are needed".

Both forms are runnable arguments to pytest. The typed list may contain both,
but every row keeps its own basis; the legacy id list remains measured-first.

**`get_change_risk(revspec=...)`** returns `impacted_tests`, computed from the
changed *lines*, so it is a strictly narrower and more useful set:

```json
{
  "status": "map_present",
  "map_present": true,
  "tests": ["tests/test_auth.py::test_login", "..."],
  "total": 23,
  "truncated": true,
  "line_coverage": {
    "untested_changes": [{"source_file": "...", "uncovered_lines": [...]}],
    "stale_test_candidates": [...],
    "covered": [...],
    "no_coverage_data": [...]
  },
  "summary": "23 test(s) cover the changed lines; showing first 10."
}
```

The `line_coverage` buckets are the honest breakdown: `untested_changes` is the
strong signal (the file *is* in the map, but nothing covers the lines you
touched), `stale_test_candidates` flags covered lines whose guarding test file is
absent from the diff, and `no_coverage_data` means the file is simply not in the
map.

`get_change_risk` deliberately omits the CLI's filename-pattern guess. An agent
cannot tell a guess from real coverage, and `no_coverage_data` already reports
those files honestly.

### Self-checking before a push

`get_change_risk` without a `revspec` measures its `patch_coverage` block over
everything a push would bring, diffed from the merge-base with the branch CI
would compare against (the CI base variables, else the default branch). On a
dirty tree that is the working tree, untracked files included, labelled e.g.
`origin/main...working tree`; on a clean one it is `origin/main...HEAD`, so the
check does not shrink to the last commit once the work is committed. With no
base to find, it falls back to the plain working-tree diff (`working tree`) or
the commit scored. No commit names uncommitted code, so its freshness is by
time: `current` when the last coverage ingest came after the newest
modification of the changed files on disk, else `stale`. Ceiling: an old
report ingested after the last edit also reads current, because the report's
own run time is not stored; the hook below only ingests reports newer than the
last ingest, which keeps that case rare. Committed changes keep the commit
rule above. When changed lines are uncovered, the directive gains one
`next_actions` line: "N changed executable lines since origin/main are
uncovered; extend <the hinted tests>", or, when the coverage is stale, a line
saying to re-run the tests with coverage first.

The loop closes itself in Claude Code and Codex. After a Bash command that
runs a whole test suite, such as `pytest`, `python -m pytest`,
`coverage run -m pytest`, `go test ./...`, `npm test`, `npx vitest run`,
`jest`, `cargo test`, `cargo llvm-cov`, `mvn test` or `./gradlew test`, the
augment hook checks the aggregate reports (`coverage.paths`, else the fixed
default locations such as `coverage/lcov.info`, `coverage.xml` and
`coverage.out`). When some are newer than the index's last coverage ingest, it
starts `repowise coverage add` on exactly those reports in the background and
adds one line to the transcript: "Re-ingesting coverage from
coverage/lcov.info in the background (log: .repowise/.coverage.log);
get_change_risk reads it once the ingest finishes."

The ingest replaces the stored coverage, so the hook is conservative. It acts
only in a repository that has ingested coverage before, only on a run that
does not target some tests (a path, a `::` node id, `-k`, `-run`, `-t`,
`--testNamePattern` or `--filter` makes a run partial, and a partial report
must not replace full-suite coverage), never on a coverage.py `.coverage`
database alone, and not when discovery is customised (`auto_discover: false`
without `paths`, or custom `artifacts` globs). A `.repowise/.coverage.queued`
marker keeps a second test run from spawning over an ingest already running
for the same reports. It costs a few file stats and one SQLite read, only
after a test command, and reads only a repo-local index. A report that only a
`**` discovery pattern finds is not watched: name it in `coverage.paths`. Turn
it off with `hooks.coverage_reingest: false` in `.repowise/config.yaml`
(`REPOWISE_HOOK_COVERAGE_REINGEST=0` for one session).

## The inferred tier: no coverage report needed

Everything above needs an ingest. Most repositories never do one, and the layer
used to have nothing to say to them: `tests_to_run` came back empty,
`impacted_tests` said "run the full suite", and `untested_hotspot` fell back to
matching filenames.

Matching filenames fails both ways, and this repository is the proof. Of its six
worst bug-magnet files, five have no file named for them anywhere under `tests/`
and so read as untested, while the graph names the tests that reach them:

| File | Filename convention | Graph |
|---|---|---|
| `ingestion/call_resolver.py` | nothing | 7 test files |
| `analysis/dead_code/analyzer.py` | nothing | 9 |
| `pipeline/persist.py` | nothing | 23 |
| `mcp_server/tool_answer/answer.py` | nothing | 18 |
| `analysis/pr_blast.py` | nothing | 3 |
| `analysis/health/engine.py` | `tests/unit/distill/test_engine.py` | 6, all under `tests/unit/health/` |

The last row is the worse failure. The convention matches on basename alone, so
it paired the health engine with the *distill* engine's tests (a different
subsystem) and called the file tested on the strength of a name collision.

Across the whole index the effect is large. Against the **80** standing
`untested_hotspot` findings the filename convention leaves behind, the call graph
clears **32** of them, 22 high and 3 critical, where the one-hop import walk this
tier used to run clears 11.

The graph already holds the relation. A test whose **calls reach** a source file
executes it, and that is a recorded edge rather than a name-shaped guess. It needs
no setup at all.

### What it is allowed to claim

| | Measured map | Inferred map |
|---|---|---|
| Comes from | a coverage report you ingested | the call graph, already indexed |
| Granularity | lines | files |
| Proves | this test executed these lines | this test's calls reach this file |
| Decays | yes: rows carry the commit they were ingested at, and `test_impact.coverage.freshness` reads `stale` once the index moves past it | no |
| May produce a percentage | yes | **never** |
| Labelled | `basis: "measured"` | `basis: "inferred"` |

The two are shown side by side and are never averaged into one number. The
canonical PR test-impact population evaluates both and retains their separate
evidence; compatibility surfaces remain measured-first. Other test-intelligence
surfaces may use inference only to fill measured silence. Inference's error is
one-sided and known, so it is sound as a floor ("something reaches this, do not
call it untested") and unsound as a quantity.

### The call graph leads, the import graph fills silence

The tier first shipped walking **import** edges one hop, which was the best of the
import-based options and still the wrong graph: a test that imports a module is
weak evidence it runs it. Release 0.44.0 made the call graph good enough to lead
with, so it does.

Dogfooded against a real `coverage run --contexts=test` over a slice where
per-test attribution is complete, both sides seeing the same 37 test files and 159
provably-executed production files:

**Forward, "what reaches this file" (suppresses `untested_hotspot`):**

| Walk | claims | correct | precision | recall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| import graph, 1 hop (what shipped before) | 43 | 31 | 72.1% | 19.5% |
| call graph, 3 hops | 48 | 44 | 91.7% | 27.7% |
| **call graph, 3 hops, filtered** (ships) | 46 | 44 | **95.7%** | **27.7%** |
| both unioned | 57 | 45 | 78.9% | 28.3% |

**Reverse, "which tests do I run" (`tests_to_run`, `impacted_tests`):**

| Walk | targets | hit rate | precision |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| import graph, 1 hop (what shipped before) | 32 | 96.9% | 94.8% |
| call graph, 3 hops, filtered | 46 | 100.0% | 97.5% |
| both unioned | 47 | 100.0% | 95.8% |
| **call graph, else import graph** (ships) | 47 | **100.0%** | **97.5%** |

The call graph wins on both axes, so it leads. **The two tiers are combined
differently per direction, because the measurements differ.** Unioning costs the
forward walk 16.8 points of precision for 0.6 of recall, and a false "something
reaches this" hides a real gap, so forward is call edges only. Reverse falls back
instead of unioning, spending the import tier only on targets the call graph left
silent, which answers one more target at identical precision.

**Depth 3 is where the call walk saturates**: 3, 4 and 5 hops return the same 48
claims and 44 confirmations, so the ceiling is the call graph's capture rate rather
than the depth. The import tier keeps its measured default of one hop.

**"Filtered" is `resolution_origin` doing work.** Not every call edge is equally
trustworthy, and this is the first thing to read the graph's own confidence
vocabulary: `global_unique`, which binds a name to the only symbol carrying it
repo-wide and which the vocabulary itself scores 0.50, is dropped. That buys **4.0
points of forward precision and 1.1 of reverse at no cost to recall**. A confidence
floor of 0.90 was tried instead and cut recall from 27.7% to 23.3%.

**Why recall reads low at 27.7%**, which is a property of the truth set rather than
the walk: `coverage` records a line as run whether a test called into it or Python
merely evaluated the module body on import, so the truth set cannot tell an
imported file from an exercised one. Splitting the 159 truth files by how much of
what ran was inside a function body: 39 ran nothing inside one at all (0% recall,
correctly), 19 ran under a quarter inside (0%), 45 a quarter to three quarters
(7%), and 56 over three quarters (**77%**). Of the 13 missed in that last group, 11
are alembic migrations the framework invokes by naming convention with no static
caller anywhere.

<sub>Reachability walks <code>EXECUTION_EDGE_TYPES</code>, which is the reachability
view minus <code>references</code> and <code>reads</code>: those record a mention
rather than a transfer of control. Dead code asks "is this used", which a mention
answers; this asks "is this run", which it does not. Both depths are keyword
arguments on the walks.</sub>

### Nothing is stored

The inferred map is read off `graph_edges` when asked and never written to
`test_coverage`. Two reasons, and the first is the one that matters:

1. **A consumer cannot mistake it for measured data.** Sharing the table behind
   a marker column would make every existing reader work immediately and would
   make every existing reader silently start returning inferred rows the day
   someone forgot to check the marker. That exact ambiguity, "no data" read as
   "not loaded", is the shape of [#1739](https://github.com/repowise-dev/repowise/issues/1739).
2. **It would be a transitive closure.** On this repository tests reach 1,630 of
   2,509 production files; materialising that is O(tests x sources) rows that go
   stale the moment the graph moves, to answer a query that is a bounded
   breadth-first search over rows already in the database.

The cost of deriving it is what makes that affordable. Indexing gains nothing:
the health pass computes the whole-repo answer in one multi-source walk, measured
at **27 ms** on this 3,700-file repository, once per run and cached. The
per-change walk is one `IN` query at depth 1, over the same edge table
`pr_blast` already reads.

## Empty means unknown, not "no tests"

This is the contract that makes the whole layer safe to act on, and it is worth
stating plainly: **an empty test list never means the change is untested.**

Both tools carry an explicit discriminator alongside the list:

- `get_change_risk` sets `status` to `"map_present"` only when a map exists.
  With no map ingested it returns `status: "inferred"` when the graph can name
  candidate test files, and `status: "no_map"`, `map_present: false` and a
  summary that says "run the full suite" when it cannot. Other degraded statuses
  are `no_index` (nothing indexed yet), `unknown` (the git read failed), and
  `no_source_line_changes`. `basis` carries the same distinction in one word.
- `get_risk` and the REST blast-radius route consume one canonical
  `test_impact` population. The directive lifts capped typed recommendations and
  keeps `tests_to_run` as a non-contradictory compatibility projection. Coverage
  availability, freshness, and measured-map presence remain explicit at
  `pr_blast_radius.test_impact.coverage`; the legacy `guarding_tests` block is a
  projection of the same rows rather than a separate derivation.

Only `status: "map_present"` with an empty `tests` list means "the map exists and
nothing in it covers this change". That is a real finding. `status: "inferred"`
is not: it is a candidate list from the import graph, and passing everything in
it does not clear a change. Everything else is an
absence of evidence, and repowise says so rather than implying a clean bill of
health. The same rule runs through the CLI ("unknown, run the full suite"), the
`no_coverage_data` bucket, and the coverage lookup helpers, which document
absence as unknown at every layer.

## Configuration

The `coverage:` block in `.repowise/config.yaml`:

```yaml
coverage:
  auto_discover: true
  artifacts:                     # override the discovery globs
    - "coverage/lcov.info"
  paths:                         # explicit reports or globs (skip discovery)
    - "coverage/lcov.info"
    - {path: "web/coverage/*.info", path_prefix: web}   # per-report prefix
  format: lcov                   # skip format sniffing
  strip_prefix: "/build/src/"    # trim an absolute prefix from report paths
  ignore: ["**/*_pb2.py"]        # gitignore-style globs coverage leaves out
  reingest_on_update: false
  fail_under: 80                 # patch-coverage gate for `coverage check` (0-100)
  min_coverable_lines: 5         # small-change tolerance for that gate
  gates:                         # path-scoped gates, judged on the files they match
    - {name: api, paths: ["/services/api/"], fail_under: 85}
    - {name: scripts, paths: ["/scripts/"], fail_under: 50, informational: true}
```

Coverage is also auto-discovered and ingested during `init` and `update`, and
`repowise init --coverage-report <path>` takes explicit reports (repeatable).
Note that `--coverage-report` is test coverage, while `--coverage` controls
*documentation* breadth. Two different things, similarly named.
