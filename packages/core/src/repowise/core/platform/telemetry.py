"""Anonymous, opt-out telemetry for the core + server layers.

A small, self-contained emitter so ``repowise.server`` (which never imports
``repowise.cli``) can record events. It shares the on-disk and wire contract
with the richer CLI telemetry in ``repowise.cli.platform.telemetry``:

* the same ``~/.repowise/platform.json`` anonymous install id,
* the same ``DO_NOT_TRACK`` / ``REPOWISE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`` consent env vars,
* the same ``POST https://api.repowise.dev/telemetry/events`` endpoint,

so CLI ``command_run`` events and server ``mcp_tool_call`` events land in one
table and group by the same install. The CLI substrate could later delegate to
this module; it is kept separate for now to avoid churning the shipped,
well-tested CLI path (upgrade path, not duplication of a subsystem).

Privacy contract (identical to the CLI's): never put source code, file paths,
repo or symbol names, query text, flag values, or anything user-identifiable
into an event's ``properties``. Coarse enums, bucketed counts, and booleans
only. Reads are best-effort and this module never raises into a caller.
