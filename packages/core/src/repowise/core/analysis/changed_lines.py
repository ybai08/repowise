"""Map a git change to the source lines it touches, per file.

``repowise risk`` reads a change as aggregate counts (``--numstat``); the
test-impact query needs the actual changed *line numbers* so it can intersect
them with per-test coverage. This module parses a ``--unified=0`` diff into
per-file records covering **both** sides of the change:

* the *new* side (``new_lines``) - the lines that exist in the head/index/
  working tree, which is the space coverage is keyed in;
* the *old* side (``old_ranges``) plus the removed/added line text, which is
  what the fix-shape classifier and (later) SZZ blame read at ``fix^``.

One parser, two consumers: :func:`changed_lines` keeps its new-side-only
contract, and the git indexer's prior-defect pass reuses
:func:`parse_unified_diff` directly rather than growing a second implementation.

Pure ``git`` subprocess walking, reusing the wrapper from the change-risk
feature extractor (no new dependency, deterministic).
