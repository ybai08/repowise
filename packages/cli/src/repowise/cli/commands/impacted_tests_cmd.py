"""``repowise impacted-tests`` - the tests a change actually exercises.

Given a diff (a ``base..head`` range, a commit, or the staged changes), map
each changed source line to the tests whose recorded coverage touches it, using
the per-test test-to-code map built by ``repowise coverage add``, and to the
tests the dependency graph shows reaching each changed file.

Honest about what it knows:
  - a changed file with per-test coverage -> the exact covering tests;
  - a changed file with no coverage rows -> candidate tests the dependency
    graph shows reaching it, or failing that a filename-pattern guess, each
    labelled with which one answered and none of them claimed as coverage;
  - a new file with neither -> "unknown, run the full suite" (never implied
    as "no tests needed").

With ``--format args`` it becomes a CI primitive: one line of arguments for a
test runner, or ``:all`` when anything about the change is uncertain (the rules
live in :mod:`repowise.core.analysis.test_selection`), with the reasons on
stderr. Selection is not a gate: it exits 0 either way, and 2 only when it
cannot read the change or the config.

Examples:
    repowise impacted-tests                 # staged changes (in CI: the PR's change)
    repowise impacted-tests main..HEAD      # a branch / PR range
    repowise impacted-tests abc123          # a single commit
    repowise impacted-tests main..HEAD --format list | xargs pytest
    repowise impacted-tests main...HEAD --format args --runner pytest
